<p>This app provides a Compass as a tile for the Android quick settings menu. It is based on a feature from an old version of <a href='https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_frameworks_base/+/179168' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>CyanogenMod</a>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Due to how Android™ works, a notification has to be displayed, while the compass is active. You can easily disable this notification by long-pressing on it or on the compass tile.</p>
